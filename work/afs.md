1998. My book “Designing Identity” has just come out. Robb Moss is in Austin to serve on the jury for the Texas Filmmaker Production Fund, to decide who gets awarded funding. When I last saw Robb, who was a film professor at Harvard, he was most likely whipping a ball to me, from shortstop to my position at second base, as I’d played softball at MIT for 13 seasons. Now in Austin, I attend the screening of his film “Riverdogs,” and offer him a copy of my book. He invites me to join him for dinner, along with AFS founder Rick Linklater, and executive director Rebecca Campbell. Of course I am aware of both Linklater and
AFS from my days in Boston, as I’m a film guy who keep his ear to the ground.

Later I get a call from Campbell: “Would you design our logo?”

“No, though I’ll do your entire identity and all other materials. But only if you put me on the board of directors.” When I stepped down from the board in 2007, at the thank-you dinner Rick said “Marc, you took us from Kansas to Oz.” Kind words from a kind man, we continued to do work for the Austin Film Society till 2012, when it was time to go on a long motorcycle trip.
