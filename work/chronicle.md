The biennial AIGA conference is to be held in my hometown, Boston. Attendees have the opportunity to lunch with a dozen design “luminaries,” and they have condescended to have me as one of them, as I was once a Bostonian, mas o menos.

I was happy to discover a former student of mine, from when I taught at my alma mater, MassArt, Vanessa Dina, at my table. Then, as now, she was an art director at San Francisco’s acclaimed Chronicle Books. I was very happy for her. As a professor, I’ve long seen myself as a bow, doing what I can to launch my arrows, my students. Some go straight and true, and I can see them hit their target. Some have a slight bend to them, and I witness their downward slant to ground. And then there are those who fly so high and far I cannot see firsthand what they’ve done or accomplished. Fortunately, Vanessa shared her experience, to the degree that soon enough, the student was now the client.

Our first project: a book on the Suicide Girls . . .
