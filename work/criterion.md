I’m coming out of the men’s room at a club in Austin. French actor and chanteuse Julie Delpy has been singing, having just premiered her latest film by and with Austin’s own writer/direc- tor Richard Linklater, Before Sunset.

A guy runs up to me and says “HEY! Some people are looking for you! They want you do design the DVD packaging for a new release of Slacker!”

If you live in Austin, there is really no excuse for not having seen Slacker, the seminal film by Rick — er, RICHARD — Linklater. It not only defines a place, but a time. And not only that, but it holds one of the champion positions in the annals of Independent Filmmaking.

So of course I was thrilled to meet the kind folks with The Criterion Collection. Criterion holds a unique place in both culture and commerce. They hold themselves to the highest standards, in terms of placing film on the pedestal it deserves, all while finding a way to ...

Why me? Met Rick thru Harvard prof and filmmaker Robb Moss, with whom I’d played softball at MIT. Then ended up doing all the branding for the Austin Film Society, which Rick started, back in ‘85. So of course Rick knew my work, especially as I’d done a piece for the 10th anniversary of Slacker. He trusts me. I cannot say enough about those who trust me. Because it’s never about me, but about me taking the time to understand them, to listen to them, and they know I’ll do that.
