The phone rings. It’s Rick — sorry, I keep forgetting, RICHARD — Linklater. He’s putting together a team, a dirty half-dozen, and he wants me to be the explosive specialist. No, that’s not quite it, but close. He’s been contacted by Hulu. They want the cache of his name, as well as the canniness of his content, on their platform. He can do whatever he wants. He doesn’t opt for a film, but instead a series. A magikal history tour series, hosted and written by the always engaging, always brilliant Timothy “Speed” Levitch.

Speed has shown up in a few of Rick’s films, as well as been the star of _________. Now, he travels the United States presenting obscure historical facts. Rick does NOT want this to be a “Ken Burns” doc,  with no slight to Mr. Burns. So I suggest maybe Monty Python? It’s a go.

Also on the team, ace editor Mike Saenz (assistant ed. on Boyhood), and composer extraordinaire Graham Reynolds. I bring on board the witty and talented animator Jake Mendez, for his own take on what my own team brings to the table. And yes, we pointedly used the typeface Mistral in the title.
