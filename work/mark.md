MARK, for discriminating skaters and collectors, makes limited-edition skateboard decks, hand silk-screened in the USA, on the finest laminated North American maple. MARK decks are not designed for a target audience, except for the ones in our collective heads. Which means they are steeped in art, culture, literature, and film.

I got an email from Mark Gobble: would I be interested in designing for his new skateboard company? Yes. Did he have a budget or any money? No.

“When I set out to look for an artist, I wanted someone who would understand 100% what this skateboard company would mean. I wanted someone deeply insightful, respectful and appreciative of the world’s cultures. I wanted someone who would bring out the soul of the decks for riders and admirers. I did not want to hire artists who have created art for skateboards before; I wanted someone ‘outside’ the skating industry. I wanted this artist to be able to offer new perspectives of what a skateboard could be.

I recalled a cover story in the Austin Chronicle about a designer named Marc English, how the cover stood out.

Pictured was a man in a North African djellaba and head scarf, with several week’s beard. The article was “English as a 2nd Language”. As I’m deaf, and as an ASL user (American Sign Language) who considers English my second language, I could appreciate the article’s title. I knew he had to contact Marc.”
