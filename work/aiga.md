I joined AIGA as soon as I got out of college, so as to continue learning about design and to begin to understand design’s role in the world beyond academia. Not without irony, it was my professors who started the Boston chapter of AIGA. One evening, while working away at my studio in school, I saw my profs far after classes were over, and asked what they were up to. They told me they were starting a local chapter for a national design group, but of course I was too busy with school to even begin to wonder what they were talking about.

There’s a good story about how I ended up as chapter president in Boston, and an even better one about how I broke up the Texas chapter to start the Austin chapter. Short version: you gotta serve your people.

There’s an equally good story about how and WHY I started AIGA/Austin’s DESIGN RANCH, stemming back to the first design conference I’d ever attended, on the edge of the Grand Canyon, in Arizona.

Before I attended my first AIGA chapter retreat, in Breckenridge, Colorado, I spent a week snowshoeing solo over the Continental Divide. Standing on the summit of Longs Peak at 14,239’ I wondered where my path would take me, as I looked back toward Boston and the east.

I’ve been fortunate. Since then I’ve been invited to speak at any number of lectures or conferences, many of which have been part of AIGA. My most recent was speaking at AIGA/Alaska, which allowed me to also knock off the final, and 50th state from my travel list. Thanx!
