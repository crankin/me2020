I joined AIGA as soon as I got out of college, so as to continue learning about design and to begin to understand design’s role in the world beyond academia. It was my professors who started the Boston chapter of AIGA. One evening, while working at my studio at MassArt, I saw my profs long after classes were over, and asked what they were up to. They told me they were starting a local chapter for a national design group, but of course I was too busy with school to even begin to wonder what they were talking about.

There’s a good story about how I ended up as chapter president in Boston, and an even better one about how I broke up the Texas chapter to start the Austin chapter. Short version: you gotta serve your people.

There’s an equally good story about how and WHY I started AIGA/Austin’s DESIGN RANCH, stemming back to the first design conference I’d ever attended, on the edge of the Grand Canyon, in Arizona. __Design Ranch note__: first year, took 3 months to sell it out, as we’d never done it. Second year took three weeks. Third year we had a waiting list of 950 (!) for an event that only accepted 150. If you’d like to know how that happened, just ask.

Before I attended my first AIGA chapter retreat, in Breckenridge, Colorado, I spent a week snowshoeing solo over the Continental Divide. Standing on the summit of  Longs Peak at 14,239’ I wondered where my path would take me, as I looked back toward Boston and the east.

I’ve been fortunate. Since then I’ve been invited to speak at any number of lectures or conferences, many of which have been part of AIGA. My most recent was speaking at AIGA/Alaska, which allowed me to also knock off the final, and 50th state from my travel list. Thanx!

<!-- LAS VEGAS POSTER
[poster front. held up to reflect the sky outside my Austin studio. those are trees reflected at bottom-left. In bottom-right of poster is an inverted rusty Mexican heart milagro. there’s another one, top-left, as on a playing card. Vegas, right?-

In the land of the blind, the one-eyed Jack is King
The road to hell is paved with good intentions
& many more bon mots for your amusement & edification

“Mr. Lucky” [For years I hoped to design a poster based on the metallic KIMLAN soy sauce packaging. Hit pay-dirt in Vegas.]

“I gave ‘em heck. Hell I’ll leave to you.” So said Al Gowan, professor at Massachusetts College of Art, when he welcomed Marc English to the design faculty. And English gave his students hell. In [spades].

From there to Texas. He made them cry. He pissed them off. He made them better. How? By giving his [heart], and teaching about not only design, but about the big picture, about [peace], [love], and yes, [happiness]. By teaching them to rise above mediocrity. Because he didn’t believe in luck. Oh, sure, he paid a visit to Luck, Wisconsin, just so he could say he’d been in luck at last once in his life. But that was the only time he’d actually gone in pursuit of it. As far as he was concerned, Lady Luck had never spread her legs for him.

Not to say he was unlucky. Like most people, he had to work for a living. Nothing was going to get handed to him. From the early days and late nights of playing guitar in [clubs], to the present days of [telephone], [airplane] and of course doing what he gets paid for - [hand with pen , exclamation point] - English has made his own luck, or what passes for it.

So if you consider it lucky that he has a wonderful daughter, great family and friends, great people to bounce ideas off, has known a great client or two in his time, and criss-crosses the States and beyond in the name of design, all while living in Austin, Texas, then, yeah, he’s lucky. Of course English would just tell you, “Rise above mediocrity! There’s no use is luck. Hell. . . that’s just the way it is.” -->
